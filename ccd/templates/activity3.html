      <li>The leaf rust resistance gene <i>Lr2a</i> provides excellent resistance when pyramided with
        <i>Lr34</i>, but almost no resistance in its absence. We will clone <i>Lr2a</i> to facilitate
        studies to understand the interaction with <i>Lr34</i>.
      </li>
      <li>RL6016 is a NIL to Thatcher (+<i>Lr2a</i>). An ONT assembly is available (Dr. Pozniak) from
        another project. A large F<sub>2</sub> population has been generated for the cross Chinese Spring/RL6016
          and is now ready for fine mapping. In addition, knock-out mutants of <i>Lr2a</i> are available

  Activitity 3.2. Suppression of Insect Resistance
</span>
<br>
<ul>
   <li>
The wheat stem sawfly (WSS) (<i>Cephus cinctus</i> Norton) is an insect pest of durum and common wheat
in the northern Great Plains of North America, affecting both grain quality and yield.
The most effective control of the WSS is to grow wheat cultivars with solid stems,
which decreases the survival rate of insect eggs and larvae. A major gene controlling
the solid-stem phenotype, <i>SSt1</i>, has been identified. We have cloned a candidate gene for
<i>SSt1</i> in durum and common wheat.
   </li>
  <li>
    Identification of <i>SSt1</i> supressors and associated molecular markers. Once identified,
      the suppression factor(s) for <i>SSt1</i> can be actively selected against in breeding to
    increase sawfly resistance in bread wheat. Unification of genomic, transcriptomic,
    and phenomic data into a systems biology model describing the mechanism of stem
    solidness and its suppression.

  Activity 3.3. Isolation of a major gene for FHB resistance in a low recombination region
</span>

     <ul>
        <li>
          The relatively narrow genetic variation for FHB resistance in elite durum wheat
          germplasm is as a major stumbling block for FHB resistance breeding in durum wheat.
            We have identified heritable FHB resistance from <i>T. diccoccum</i> accession TG3475151
          and have localized a major QTL (<i>QFHB-cdc.5A</i>) on chromosome 5A that is
          highly stable across environments. This QTL appears to be syntenic to a stable QTL
          identified in cultivated emmer wheat, and is present in a few historical Canadian breeding lines.
        </li>
        <li>
            Improve resolution of <i>QFHB-cdc.5A</i>, identify <i>QFHB-cdc.5A</i> carriers
          in different genetic backgrounds and breeding materials,
          and develop robust DNA markers to support marker-assisted breeding.
