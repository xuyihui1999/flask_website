INSERT INTO `objectives` VALUES (20,'SNP pipeline','A high-throughput and efficient bioinformatics pipeline for systematic variant (SNP and indel) mining from next generation sequences of diploid and polyploid genotypes.','A highly automated and configurable pipeline package will be delivered to the public and will be potentially useful in any self-pollinating species. This tool is needed immediately to handle the data expected from this project and to systematically format the variant discovery for the project database.\r',9),(25,'Genome-wide survey sequencing and bisulfite sequence','Survey (skim) sequences with and without sodium bisulfite treatment from a set of AAFC synthetic wheat lines selected for their differential vernalization requirements. Alignment of sequence data from selected germplasm including two diploid D genome parents, two tetraploid AABB genome parents and four synthetic lines, and prediction of DNA methylation sites. (Objective is conditional on availability of regulatory array from CTAG2)','The aligned survey sequence will provide a foundational genomic resource that can be used for marker development and to interpret DNA methylation patterns in these genotypes. Uncovering the source of novel phenotypic variation generated in genetically uniform lines that possess different vernalization requirements provides a unique opportunity to add to the knowledge of flowering time control. Generation of DNA methylation profiles of key AAFC germplasm will uncover polymorphisms associated with differing vernalization responses. The majority of wheat varieties grown in Canada are spring types adapted to the environment found on the Canadian prairies. Strategies to expand the variation available to wheat breeders often involve transferring favourable alleles from wild relatives through interspecific hybridization. The transfer of undesirable vernalization alleles often complicates these strategies. Information from this work may provide alternate strategies to eliminate vernalization d',10),(40,'RNA sequencing','An RNASeq analysis from the eight wheat lines characterized in previous objectives of meristem tissues pre- and post-vernalization will link to the small RNA objective. In addition, a global transcriptomic approach will be applied to obtain expression data from a wide range of tissues in all eight genotypes with specific emphasis on reproductive tissues. ','Here, we clearly see that all dataset layers are interlinked to provide a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms that could lead to differential gene expression and silencing. While it is impossible to look at a large number of traits, we have carefully selected the germplasm to investigate the winter/spring habit phenotype because it can be easily and clearly measured. Such phenotype will serve as proof of concept. However, phenotypic data of agronomic performance, fusarium head blight and leaf rust resistance of this germplasm is currently being collected through an on-going project. Eventually, we plan to apply the layered data to the other phenotypic data to better understand their genetic and epigenetic controls. Also special emphasis will be placed on reproductive tissues to provide insights into mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance in synthetics.\r',13),(50,'Backcross population development','Backcross populations (BC1F1 and BC2F1) will be created by crossing all four primary synthetics to an adapted elite spring wheat (Carberry) and winter wheat (Emerson).','Tissues from the populations will be sampled for future DNA and RNA experiments such as those described above to further elucidate gene silencing and activation mechanisms. The phenotypic data on the growth habit will provide useful information on such mechanisms for this trait.\r',15),(70,'DNA markers','Development and uptake of DNA markers in wheat, oat, and barley cultivar development programs through the direct involvement and engagement of wheat, barley, and oat breeders.','The bioinformatics analyses and tools will be validated in some real-world projects within the timeframe of this project, but the database and tools will continue to have high impact in breeding programs well-beyond project completion.\r',19),(5,'Germplasm','A definitive core collection of cultivated and wild germplasm in each of wheat, oat, and barley suitable for sequencing, allele mining, and SNP development.','This core germplasm collection will encompass a wide spectrum from wild relatives of the secondary and tertiary gene pools to progenitors of the primary gene pools (including both wild and domesticated forms), to synthetics, landraces and cultivars.  These two resources (DNA and seeds) will be made available for distribution to other Scientists for additional genotyping (e.g. genome sequencing, epigenetics, RNA-Seq) and/or phenotyping (disease, agronomics, quality) characterization. ',20),(10,'Oat gene capture array','The first global gene capture assay for oat.','The first novel gene capture array for use in oat will be published and shared openly with investigators in the oat community. Widespread uptake of this exome capture platform will benefit the community through the incremental development of experimental data and annotations, and the development of more diversity data by the community. ',21),(15,'Exome sequences','Deep coverage of exome sequences, assembled into accurate representations of gene space from core germplasm collections in wild and cultivated germplasm from wheat, oat, and barley, as well as synthetic hexaploids in wheat.','Ability to mine SNPs from cultivated germplasm, and gene variants from crop wild relatives. This sequence data will also provide information on the allelic diversity and underlying heterozygosity within progenitors, synthetics and synthetic-derived germplasm. In wheat, these data will be interpreted together with epigenetic analyses to identify mechanisms leading to gene silencing that balance the expression of homologous genes situated on the A, B and D genomes.  ',22),(30,'Histone modification analysis','Measurement of four chromatin marks throughout the wheat genome of the eight wheat lines characterized in previous objectives. These chromatin marks are known to activate or silence gene expression and their role in determining the observed flowering time variation in otherwise genetically uniform lines will be investigated.','Detection of specific histone methylation/acetylation profiles in key AAFC germplasm will uncover polymorphisms associated with different vernalization responses. Flowering time is among the most important traits under selection in breeding programs.  Understanding the regulation of this trait is beneficial to the wheat breeding industry.  The novel flowering time responses observed in genetically uniform lines generated through re-synthesis offers a unique opportunity to gain insight into how new combinations of AABB and DD genomes interact to generate novel phenotypic variation. ',23),(35,'Small RNA sequencing','Sequenced small RNA (siRNA) libraries from anthers, ovaries and meristems pre- and post-vernalization of the eight wheat lines characterized in previous objectives. Annotation and expression analyses of small RNA libraries.','The siRNAs originate mostly from repetitive elements, serving as silencing mechanisms. Those originating from well characterized families will be investigated. Mining of these data will allow us to understand the role these small non-coding molecules play in transgenerational inheritance of some epigenetic mechanisms such as the silencing or activation of repetitive elements and genes, phenomena that can create novel variation and result in phenotype differences. Bursts of transposition events in wheat have been reported for the Sasanda retroelement at a time coincident to the advent of hexaploid wheat. This led us to hypothesize that polyploidization could have caused a genomic stress that activated transposition. Here, we will test this hypothesis using newly created synthetic wheats that mimic the original hybridization events that occurred approximately ten thousand years ago. Understanding of these mechanisms could lead to the development of methods to “control” transposition for ',24),(45,'Candidate gene analysis','An in-depth sequence and diversity analysis in cultivated and wild germplasm of candidate genes in wheat, oat, and barley that show homology to genes implicated in fungal resistance, flowering time, cellulose synthesis, and hull adhesion. Prediction of synonymous vs non-synonymous mutations in coding regions, and assessment of relative divergence rate among different genes and gene families.','This work will provide information on new alleles for genes that are not present in primary gene pools of each species, and recommendations for further work and validation experiments using diverse alleles from target traits.  Furthermore, the analysis of model genes in collaboration with colleagues will facilitate the development of additional expertise and bioinformatics tools in our laboratories and those of collaborators. ',25),(55,'phylogeny analysis','Phylogeny analysis using defined gene sets at a level of species-diversity and gene-coverage never-before achieved will be conducted in oat. ','This work will provide a unique opportunity to refine and validate the relationships among species in the crop wild relatives of oat.  This information will be used to make educated decisions regarding the implementation of wide crosses in this crop. ',26),(60,'Database','A set of three crop genome databases for wheat, oat, and barley, developed and maintained in parallel, containing annotated gene predictions with SNP and Indel predictions from cultivated species, gene variant alignments from crop wild relatives, and annotated tracks identifying epigenetic variants in experimental material (see separate objectives). Databases will have a user-friendly query system allowing extraction of key data, or export of specific file formats (e.g. for SNP development or for phylogeny analysis).  Database will use elements of the open source GBrowse system as well as custom elements developed by Dr You’s team.','The database will be available initially to all collaborators, and by the end of the project, it will be published online and/or made available as an installable package. One type of user will be scientists performing experiments related to gene discovery or allele mining, who will then have pre-emptive data on gene variants, providing direct information for validation experiments, or the ability to better target new research hypotheses. The second type of user will be plant breeders, who currently lack the ability to quickly develop alternate or improved assays for targets of marker-assisted selection. ',27),(65,'Epigenetic database layers in wheat','Additional database layers (tracks) in the wheat genome database providing integrative views for the combined interpretation of genic and epigenomic data.','The individual processed and analyzed epigenetic datasets will have value on their own to answer specific hypotheses, but the real value will be the incorporation of all the data layers into a single database. Here, one will be able to understand the relationship between various data layers. For example, is this synthetic wheat a spring type because one of the vernalization genes is silenced through methylation of its promoter or through miRNA down-regulation or as a consequence of chromatin remodeling or a combination of each layer of regulation?  The analysis of these layers of gene regulation will uncover how quantitative trait variations manifest themselves.  Armed with this information, we will be able to ask why crosses between spring type durum cv. Langdon generate winter synthetics while crosses with the same diploid but other tetraploids do not. The measurable of this objective will be in the query power, ease of use, visualization and extraction tools. We anticipate that the ',28);

FPCBrowser was initially designed as a portable physical map viewer to comprehensively view FPC contig maps and related information such as clones, fingerprints, and markers in multiple platforms. A Java-based relational database, HSQLDB, was adopted in FPCBrowser to store all source data of a FPC contig map and the fingerprints of BAC clones in a physical mapping project.

This tool first identifies potentially unique repeat junctions using BLAST against fully annotated repeat databases and a repeat junction finding algorithm, and then designs TE based primers using Primer3 and BatchPrimer3. Five primer design strategies of TE based PCR markers have been implemented in this tool, including RJM, RJJM, ISBP, RBIP, and IRAP. Both a web-based server and a command line based pipeline have been implemented to meet different requirements.

Multiple genome equivalents of shotgun reads of another individual generated with SOLiD or Solexa are then mapped to the annotated Roche 454 reads to identify putative SNPs. The pipeline is suitable for SNP discovery in genomic libraries of complex genomes and does not require a reference genome sequence. The pipeline is applicable to all current NGS platforms, provided that at least one of them generates relatively long reads. This pipeline package is available upon request.','',10),('BatchPrimer3','High Throughput Marker/Primer Development','BatchPrimer3 is a comprehensive web primer design program using Primer3 core program as a major primer design engine to design different types of PCR primers and sequencing primers in a high-through manner. BatchPrimer3 allows users to design several types of primers including generic primers, hybridization oligos, SSR primers together with SSR detection, and SNP genotyping primers (including single-base extension primers, allele-specific primers, and tetra-primers for tetra-primer ARMS PCR), as well as DNA sequencing primers. A batch input of large number of sequences and a tab-delimited result output greatly facilitates rapid primer design and ordering process.','',11);
